MSP430POV_V2
============

Version 2 of the MSP430 based persistance of vision thing.

The PCBs for this version are intended to be manufactured professionally.

Basic software to display a Pac Man style ghost included.

TODO: Add the abililty to load messages via the com port. Need to look at how to save messages into flash so they are persistant. Currently firmware will need to be loaded onto the chip using a suitable TI Launchpad as a programmer.
